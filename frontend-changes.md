# Frontend Changes - Dark/Light Theme Toggle

## Overview
Added a toggle button that allows users to switch between dark and light themes for the Course Materials Assistant interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`index.html`)
- **Added theme toggle button** positioned in the top-right corner
- Button includes both sun and moon SVG icons for visual clarity
- Includes proper accessibility attributes (`aria-label`, `title`)
- Button is keyboard navigable with proper focus handling

### 2. CSS Styling (`style.css`)

#### Theme Variables
- **Extended CSS custom properties** with separate variable sets for light and dark themes
- Dark theme remains the default (existing `:root` variables)
- Light theme variables defined under `:root[data-theme="light"]` selector

#### New Components
- **`.theme-toggle`** - Fixed position button (top: 1rem, right: 1rem)
- Circular button (48px Ã— 48px) with smooth hover and focus effects
- **Theme icon animations** with opacity and rotation transitions
- Icons smoothly transition between sun (light theme) and moon (dark theme)

#### Enhanced Transitions
- Added `transition` properties to body and key UI elements
- 0.3s ease transitions for background-color, border-color, and color changes
- Smooth theme switching with no jarring color changes

### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)

#### Theme Management Functions
- **`initializeTheme()`** - Loads saved theme preference from localStorage or defaults to dark
- **`toggleTheme()`** - Switches between light and dark themes
- **`setTheme(theme)`** - Applies theme by setting/removing `data-theme` attribute on document root

#### Persistence & Accessibility
- **localStorage integration** - User's theme preference is saved and restored on page load
- **Dynamic aria-labels** - Button's accessibility label updates based on current theme
- **System preference detection** - Respects user's OS theme preference if no explicit choice is made
- **Keyboard navigation** - Button responds to Enter and Space key presses

#### Event Handling
- Click and keyboard event listeners for the theme toggle button
- Proper event prevention for keyboard interactions
- MediaQuery listener for system theme preference changes

### 4. Design Features

#### Visual Design
- **Icon-based toggle** using sun/moon symbols that are universally understood
- **Smooth animations** with rotating and scaling effects on hover
- **Material Design-inspired** hover effects with subtle shadows and scale transforms
- **Consistent styling** that matches the existing design aesthetic

#### Accessibility Features
- **WCAG compliant** with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **High contrast** maintained in both themes
- **Focus indicators** with custom focus ring styling
- **Screen reader friendly** with descriptive labels that update based on state

#### User Experience
- **Immediate theme switching** with no page reload required
- **Persistent preferences** that survive browser restarts
- **Smooth transitions** prevent jarring color changes
- **Intuitive placement** in the top-right corner as commonly expected

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Architecture
- Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theme switching
- Leverages CSS attribute selectors (`[data-theme="light"]`) for theme detection
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing styles

### JavaScript Architecture
- Modular function design for easy maintenance
- Error-safe localStorage operations
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal DOM manipulation (only `data-theme` attribute changes)
- CSS transitions handled by browser's optimized rendering engine
- No external dependencies or heavy libraries

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting CSS custom properties
- Graceful degradation for older browsers (dark theme remains functional)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/index.html` - Added theme toggle button HTML
2. `frontend/style.css` - Added theme variables, button styles, and transitions
3. `frontend/script.js` - Added theme management JavaScript functionality
